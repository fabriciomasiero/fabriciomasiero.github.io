        "content": "My app supports from iOS 9 to the latest released by Apple (13) and I would like it to be dark theme and light theme. It‚Äôs possible?\nSearching for WWDC articles I noticed that the way Apple does is using\n\nColors.assets\n\nPRETTY! I created a color asset in the app and started setting it up. But‚Ä¶ what I feared came true. Support only for the. iOS 11+. Great Scott!\n\nColor Document\nI had to think of other ways to do something sustainable and work.\nStarting with creating an extension called\n\nColor.swift\n\n\n\nUse Color Literal for fuller and more native viewing. All app colors should be there, organized and standardized üëå. Say goodbye to colorWithHex () üòé üíÅ\n\nWonderful, but how would this work as dark mode? Simple, separate the colors that are dark themed and those that are not. For example, Plurall is my app name and purple is its color, it should not necessarily be dark themed.\n\nThe following is an example of colors that contemplate both theme types (can be scaled for more than that üë®‚Äçüíª)\n\n\n\nBut‚Ä¶Why this¬†Colors?\n\nI keep these variables above to the same extent and they are color changeable. The system understands perfectly when to use each one. But where did I get in those dark colors? Why of them?\n\nWell, I‚Äôm not officially a designer, I don‚Äôt have this skill but I venture anyway ‚ò∫Ô∏è.\n\nBut then, what about the dark colors? I used the Inverted Color technique (here a site that will help you invert the color - Invert Colors), so I can maintain the same contrast and visualization usability that my app had before Dark Mode, using colors that still talk to each other.\nAnd why does Apple use full-black in its native apps? The high-end iPhones (iPhone X, iPhone XS and iPhone 11 Pro) contain OLED screen and black is faithful, these screens can uses less battery in black pixels.\n\nSo, this is how I developed this feature for the app that can work from iOS 9. As seen in the code, it still does not work in the past iOS, this is a decision we still have to talk internally, but it is easy to implement this change¬†.\n\nI think it‚Äôs time to show how the app is doing, right?\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nLogin Screen(Plurall only works on Brazil, sorry)\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nSide menu, I know, need to update this¬†üòë\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nA Task Workflow(app for students)\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nWorks also in WKWebKit¬†üòé\n\nThere is only one ‚Äúbad‚Äù side to this whole story, setting the colors manually üòí.\n\nIf you use XIB or Storyboard (like me) it will be more work, but nothing too painful. If you‚Äôre one of those who does the whole layout via code, nothing changes for you, champion! Either way you‚Äôll find a lot of it out there!\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this, I will talk with the design team and see what changes we can make for a better view, I can see some display failures, not respecting the 21: 1 or even 4.5: 1 contrast.\nApart from this visual change, what has changed?\n\n\n\nWell, I revisited all the code (it‚Äôs an old app, a lot of legacy stuff) and put it in my head:‚Ää-‚ÄäDon‚Äôt refactor complex things, fix force unwraps and other easy-to-maintain silly things.\nSo, I tweaked all the app colors (which were a mess,), tweaked small errors from XIBs and Storyboards, removed countless classes that weren‚Äôt relevant, and again, the app colors are completely organized and visual.\n\n\n\nI hope I have helped everyone looking for this change. \nIf you would like to extend the discussion, call me on Twitter\n\nHappy Coding¬†:)\n",

        "content": "\n\nFirst of all, I would like to introduce myself, I am Fabr√≠cio Masiero, I have been working with iOS for over 8 years and today I lead a team in the largest education company in Brazil.\n\nWhy is presentation important? Because it can help you choose the ideal event. I will explain it throughout the text.\n\nEvery iOS Developer dreams of going to one of these events and I will share my experiences in each one.\nMy first event was in 2016, the last year at the Moscone Center ‚Äî San Francisco. I went to AltConf alone, knowing nothing and nobody. The event itself was not as famous as it is today, the talks took place inside a cinema, they had limited space and little infrastructure. It was amazing, I learned a lot and met a lot of interesting people.\n\nThe following year, I went with a friend. He went to WWDC and I went to AltConf. It was in that year that I understood what were the differences between the events, even though I had never participated in WWDC until then.\n\nIn those years, I had autonomy and the possibility to use in practice everything I learned in the events\n\n\n\nIn 2018, my company sponsored WWDC. I felt the chill in my belly again when I first went to AltConf. I did everything that a first-time dub needs to do: catch queues, wake up early for the keynote and choose all the talks he was interested in advance.\nI learned a lot, I met a lot of people (including Tim) and it was totally incredible.\n\n\n\nOkay, now I need to put what I learned into practice‚Ä¶ But can you put it all into production? Can you use all the news I learned, day by day? Even more, referring to Brazilian users who do not always update at the same speed as Apple products are launched.\n\nNo, unfortunately not. Many of the novelties depend on something. Whether iOS updated, or device or any other reason.\n\nWWDC is awesome! Able to bring some indescribable feeling to be there, see everything I saw on Apple LiveStream and learn all these new technologies.\n\nAltConf is awesome too! Able to introduce you to great programming talents, such as the creator of Alamofire or Fastlane. The good thing about Alt‚Äôs talks is that the content is more palpable, the speakers show everyday examples, develop frameworks that make the developer‚Äôs life easier for today.\n\nThis year, 2019, I‚Äôm going to AltConf again. This time the company was unable to sponsor and I am going on my own at Alt. I particularly liked WWDC, because that is my profile.\nI have a great friend who was also in both and he prefers AltConf a thousand times. In 2018 he was even one of the invited speakers.\n\nThe question is simple, participate in both. These are incredible events, but each one has a different focus.\n\nNever been to any event? Go! You don‚Äôt have to go to WWDC (if money and lottery are impediments), just go to AltConf, meet people, feel what it‚Äôs like to be with that crowd that week. Worth every penny.\n\nPS *: Join the parties\n\nA hug\nFabr√≠cio Masiero\n",
