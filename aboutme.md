# My Story # 

Hi! My name is Fabrício Masiero,
Born in São Paulo, Brazil, in 4th february of 1992.
Im starting my career of developer on 2010 developing JAVA applications, but on that time im was totally in love with mobile gadgets. Mesmo iPhone released on 2007, in Brazil this culture was become popular on 2010, because here is too expensive to earn an good mobile. Ok, I take all my economys and ask help to my parents to buy an MacBook Pro early 2011(THE BUGGEST ONE), start to studying and make a course of one week on Caelum(braziliam school of technologies and development), after this Im stay focused on study iOS development and stay working on estagio of JAVA development. A few months later I found a company whos need a Jr iOS Developer, so I apply. On that time in Brazil is really hard to found iOS dev jobs, company at that time dont are focused on that kind of development. I got the job and now began the first part of my iOS development story.

# Jr. iOS Developer # 

Now Im working on Neo7Apps, braziliam startup, and my first project I need to develop an app to iPhone and iPad, and for me, this was a big challenge for me, but its is not all. In the same app I need to present a 3D Heart mande on unity. So basically I need to put this unity code on my iOS application. After a lot of study and tryings I do! After this big project I work on other projects inside this company. Family Schurman and Palavra Cantada.
